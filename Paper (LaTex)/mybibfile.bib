abstract = "This article presents the outcomes of a recent study carried out among wind energy manufacturers and developers regarding the current generation costs of wind energy projects in Europe, the factors that most influence them, as well as the reasons behind their recent increase and their expected future evolution. The research finds that the generation costs of an onshore wind farm are between 4.5 and 8.7€cent/kWh; 6–11.1€cent/kWh when located offshore, with the number of full hours and the level of capital cost being the most influencing elements. Generation costs have increased by more than 20% over the last 3 years mainly due to a rise of the price of certain strategic raw materials at a time when the global demand has boomed. However, the competitive position of wind energy investments vis-à-vis other technologies has not been altered. In the long-term, one would expect production costs go down; whether this will be enough to offset the higher price of inputs will largely depend on the application of correct policies, like R\&D in new materials, O\&M with remote-control devices, offshore wind turbines and substructures; introduction of advanced siting and forecasting techniques; access to adequate funding; and long-term legal stability."

abstract = "This paper exploits the exogeneity of weather conditions to evaluate renewable energy (RE) subsidies in Germany and Spain in terms of their short-run direct program costs for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. We find that both aggregate costs and their distribution between energy producers and consumers vary significantly depending on which type of RE technology is promoted — reflecting substantial heterogeneity in production costs, temporal availability of natural resources, and market conditions, i.e., time-varying demand, carbon intensity of installed production capacities, and opportunities for cross-border trade. We estimate that the costs for reducing 1 ton of CO2 through subsidies for solar are 411 to 1944 €. Subsidizing wind entails significantly lower costs, ranging from 82 to276 €. In the short run, the economic rents for energy producers always decrease, while consumers incur four to seven times larger costs when solar is promoted but gain under RE policies promoting wind."

abstract = "In the face of energy crisis and environmental impacts of conventional energy sources, renewable energy sources have attracted tremendous interest. Among many resources, wind energy has proven to be a promising renewable energy option in recent times. The primary objective of utilizing renewable energy is its environmental sustainability and the idea of emission reduction constitutes a prominent part in it. The emission here refers to the CO2, SO2 and NOx emissions from thermal power plants. However, recent research works suggest that there remains a considerable anomaly between the claims of emission reduction by wind energy developers and the actual emissions, particularly with the integration of wind power into the grid system. The estimation methodology involving tools like wind resource assessment and energy capture may not provide accurate estimates due to some power system generation and operational constraints. The objective of the present study is to analyse the impact of wind turbine ratings and economic emission dispatch (EED) on the generation cost and emissions in wind integrated power systems. In this regard, the study investigates the concept of emission factor and wind-integrated EED. Wind turbines available at different rated power and rated speeds are incorporated in four different test power systems and the actual cost and emissions over a selected period are evaluated. Finally, the impact of the wind power integration on the generation cost savings and emission reduction is investigated."

abstract = "Future scenarios with significant anthropogenic climate change also display large increases in world production of fossil fuels, the principal CO2 emission source. Meanwhile, fossil fuel depletion has also been identified as a future challenge. This chapter reviews the connection between these two issues and concludes that limits to availability of fossil fuels will set a limit for mankind's ability to affect the climate. However, this limit is unclear as various studies have reached quite different conclusions regarding future atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by fossil fuel limitations. It is concluded that the current set of emission scenarios used by the IPCC and others is perforated by optimistic expectations on future fossil fuel production that are improbable or even unrealistic. The current situation, where climate models largely rely on emission scenarios detached from the reality of supply and its inherent problems are problematic. In fact, it may even mislead planners and politicians into making decisions that mitigate one problem but make the other one worse. It is important to understand that the fossil energy problem and the anthropogenic climate change problem are tightly connected and need to be treated as two interwoven challenges necessitating a holistic solution."

abstract={As the Earth warms, many species are likely to disappear, often because of changing disease dynamics. Here we show that a recent mass extinction associated with pathogen outbreaks is tied to global warming. Seventeen years ago, in the mountains of Costa Rica, the Monteverde harlequin frog (Atelopus sp.) vanished along with the golden toad (Bufo periglenes). An estimated 67\% of the 110 or so species of Atelopus, which are endemic to the American tropics, have met the same fate, and a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) is implicated. Analysing the timing of losses in relation to changes in sea surface and air temperatures, we conclude with 'very high confidence' (> 99\%, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) that large-scale warming is a key factor in the disappearances. We propose that temperatures at many highland localities are shifting towards the growth optimum of Batrachochytrium, thus encouraging outbreaks. With climate change promoting infectious disease and eroding biodiversity, the urgency of reducing greenhouse-gas concentrations is now undeniable.},

abstract = "The exploitation of wind energy worldwide comprises one of the main factors for reaching the targets towards a non-fossil fuel era set by many countries. Nowadays, onshore wind power is an established industry with significant contribution to energy production. On the other hand, offshore wind power is an emerging industry where numerous challenges should be faced. Apart from the main components such as platforms, turbines, cables, and substations, offshore installations include also the manufacturing, construction, shipping, and decommissioning phases. Additionally, the Operation & Maintenance (O&M) activities consist of employees’ transportation by vessel or helicopter and occasional hardware retrofits. Therefore, various life cycle (LC) stages of offshore projects present a carbon footprint which affects their sustainable character in a more significant way than onshore ones. Concerning the environmental uncertainties arisen from the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of offshore wind power generation, the present work intents to provide a literature review on the LC carbon and energy footprint of offshore wind power projects compared to the onshore counterparts."

@article{capability_of_wind_power_accomodation_in_regional_power_grids,
Abstract = {With the development of large-scale wind power integration, wind curtailment appears around the world, especially in China. It is essential to perform the assessment on capability of wind power accommodation (ACWPA) by calculating the maximum admissible wind power which plays an important role in system planning and operation. This paper proposes a long-term assessment on the maximum level of wind power installed capacity in future years based on peak power regulation, with consideration of potential wind curtailment. Meanwhile, a short-term assessment based on wind power forecasting is developed through day-ahead unit commitment to get admissible zone of wind power in grid operation. In particular, the extreme wind variation scenario (EWVS) calculated by quadratic programming (QP) is applied to optimize upper limit of admissible zone. Case studies are carried out to analyze wind power characteristics in a province in Southern China. Results show that the proposed approaches can effectively and accurately evaluate the capability of wind power accommodation in regional power grids.},
